# Smart Sight Cane
Smart Sight Cane is an innovative project designed to assist visually impaired individuals by using advanced object detection and distance measurement technologies.
By integrating a camera and ultrasonic sensor with a Raspberry Pi, the cane helps users detect obstacles and navigate their surroundings more safely and independently.

## Features <br>
-**Real-Time Object Detection**: Utilizes a camera to identify and name objects in the user's path. <br>
-**Distance Measurement**: Measures the distance to obstacles using an ultrasonic sensor, providing auditory feedback to the user.<br>
-**Auditory Feedback**: Uses text-to-speech technology to inform the user about the identified objects and their distances. <br>
