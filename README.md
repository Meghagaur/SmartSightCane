# Smart Sight Cane
Smart Sight Cane is an innovative project designed to assist visually impaired individuals by using advanced object detection and distance measurement technologies.
By integrating a camera and TF-miniS lidar with a Raspberry Pi, the cane helps users detect obstacles and navigate their surroundings more safely and independently.
